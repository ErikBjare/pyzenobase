A small and simple (but helpful) library to aid in uploading and fetching data to/from [Zenobase](https://zenobase.com/).

## Installation
Install by using any of the following commands, prefix with `sudo` if necessary.
 - `pip3 install git+https://github.com/ErikBjare/pyzenobase.git`
 - `pip3 install .` after cloning into working directory
 - `python3 ./setup.py install` after cloning into working directory

## Examples
Check out the examples in `./examples`.

## Documentation
Not yet available, but codebase is small so reading `./pyzenobase/main.py` should be enough to understand how to use it.
For info about the general Zenobase API, look [here](https://zenobase.com/#/api/).
